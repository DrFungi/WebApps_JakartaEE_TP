This project will allow me to learn how to use servlets in a Java project.
I was able to connect to an online database and extract the data.
I was able to perform calculations on the extracted data via 2 service classes and one interface.
This project allows the user to choose which authority to use when calculating taxes
    for now it only allows 2 choices, Quebec and Canada but can easily be implemented for other provinces
I faced many obstacles writing this project, among them was the configuration of the WildFly server
    because Github does not keep the local configuration of the project and I had to find a way to do it
I was most happy when I was able to style my index.jsp
